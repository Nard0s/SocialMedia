# 🚀 Welcome to **Social Media Simulator 3000** 🌈✨

**This is not real. It's just very, very good-looking.** 😎  

I built this project to **practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub**!  
There’s no backend, no real database, no actual chatting or posting...  
But hey — it **looks** like you can do all that, and sometimes *fake it 'til you make it* works! 💪😆

## 🎯 What's Inside?

- 📝 **Post Section** — Looks like you can post. (But actually... you can't. 😂)
- 📖 **Story Section** — Looks like Instagram Stories. (But... no one's really watching 😁)
- 💬 **Chat Section** — Looks like you can chat. (But you'll be ghosted by the app itself 👻)
- 🎨 **Theme/Color Changer** — This actually works! Magic! 🌟
